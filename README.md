# ESL

My own solutions to the practical exercises of Ref. [\[1\]](#ref). 

## Usage 

All scripts are coded in Python using Jupyter notebooks. 
The datasets used in the exercises are also uploaded. 
The original zip files for these datasets can be found at the following link:

## Description

These are short descriptions of the exercises that I have solved so far. 
Full descriptions are reported in the notebooks, and in the extended commit messages. 

### Exercise 2.8 

A first estimation of classification performance of linear regression and *k*-nearest neighbor on the **zipcode** dataset.   

### Exercise 4.9

Classification of the **vowel** dataset using quadratic discriminant analysis. Also added a reduced-rank analysis for data visualization.   

### Exercise 11.5

First principles implementation of backprop algorithm, and its application to a synthetic datasets. 

### Exercise 13.7

Mode advanced problem on *k*-nearest neighbor classification: misclassification error, cross-validation, bias-variance tradeoff.   

### Exercise 13.8

A problem on techniques for improving *k*-nearest neighbor algorithm: 
  - adding hints 
  - invariant metric
  - tangent distance 
Best number of neighbors to be found using cross-validation.
